    "   - **Check:** Examine scatter plots of the independent variables against the dependent variable. If the points roughly form a straight line, the assumption is reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independence of Errors:**\n",

    "   - **Assumption:** The independent variables are not correlated with the residuals.\n",
    "   - **Check:** Use subject matter knowledge and additional tests if needed.\n",

The basic idea is to iteratively move towards the minimum of the cost function by adjusting the model parameters in the direction that leads to a decrease in the cost.\n",

    "   - Start with initial values for the model parameters (weights and biases).\n",

    "2. **Compute the Gradient:**\n",
    "   - Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter. The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest increase in the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update Parameters:**\n",
    "   - Adjust the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient to reduce the cost. This adjustment is done by multiplying the gradient by a learning rate (a small positive value) and subtracting it from the current parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iterate:**\n",
    "   - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence or a predefined number of iterations. Convergence occurs when the change in the cost becomes very small.\n",

    "**Types of Gradient Descent:**\n",
    "- **Batch Gradient Descent:** Uses the entire dataset to compute the gradient in each iteration.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Computes the gradient using only one random data point in each iteration, making it faster but more erratic.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent:** A compromise between batch and stochastic, using a small random subset of the data in each iteration.\n",

    "**Differences from Linear Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nature of Relationship:**\n",
    "   - Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. In contrast, polynomial regression allows for more flexible and nonlinear relationships.\n",
