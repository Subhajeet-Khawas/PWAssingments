    "Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in a dataset's distribution. In other words, it quantifies the degree and direction of skew (departure from horizontal symmetry) in the data. Skewness provides insights into the shape of the distribution, particularly regarding the concentration of values on one side of the mean compared to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of Skewness:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Positively Skewed (Right Skewed):**\n",
    "   - The right tail of the distribution is longer or fatter than the left.\n",
    "   - Most values are concentrated on the left side of the mean.\n",
    "   - The mean is typically greater than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Negatively Skewed (Left Skewed):**\n",
    "   - The left tail of the distribution is longer or fatter than the right.\n",
    "   - Most values are concentrated on the right side of the mean.\n",
    "   - The mean is typically less than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Symmetrical (Zero Skewness):**\n",
    "   - The distribution is perfectly balanced, with equal tail lengths on both sides of the mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Calculation of Skewness:\n",
    "\n",
    "The skewness of a dataset (denoted as \\( \\text{Skewness} \\)) can be calculated using the formula:\n",
