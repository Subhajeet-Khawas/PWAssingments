    "A database is a collection of data that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used to store all sorts of data, including customer information, product inventory, and financial records.\n",

    "There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SQL databases use a structured query language (SQL) to store and retrieve data. SQL is a standard language that is used by most relational databases. Relational databases store data in tables, which are made up of rows and columns. Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a single piece of data about that record.\n",
    "2. NoSQL databases do not use SQL. Instead, they use a variety of different data models, including document, key-value, and graph databases. Document databases store data in documents, which are similar to JSON objects. Key-value databases store data in key-value pairs, where the key is a unique identifier and the value is any type of data. Graph databases store data in graphs, which are made up of nodes and edges. Nodes represent entities, such as people or products, and edges represent relationships between entities."
