    "**Ordinal Encoding:**\n",
    "- Ordinal encoding is a technique where categorical values are assigned unique numerical codes based on their ordinal relationships or predefined order.\n",
    "- It is suitable when the categorical values have a meaningful order or hierarchy.\n",
    "- Example: Education level (High School < Bachelor's < Master's < PhD)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label Encoding:**\n",
    "- Label encoding is a more general technique where each unique category is assigned a unique numerical label without necessarily implying any order.\n",
    "- It is suitable for nominal variables with no inherent order.\n",
    "- Example: Colors (Red, Blue, Green)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference:**\n",
    "- The key difference lies in the nature of the categorical variable and the relationships between its categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario:**\n",
    "Consider a dataset with a \"Temperature\" column:\n",
    "- Ordinal Encoding: If the temperature categories are \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" and \"High\" with a clear order, you might choose ordinal encoding to represent them as 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n",
    "- Label Encoding: If the temperature categories are \"Cold,\" \"Hot,\" and \"Warm,\" with no clear order, you might choose label encoding to represent them as 1, 2, and 3 without implying any specific order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Choose:**\n",
    "- Choose **Ordinal Encoding** when the categorical variable has a meaningful order or hierarchy, and the order carries relevant information for the model.\n",
    "- Choose **Label Encoding** when the categorical variable is nominal, and there is no inherent order among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**\n",
    "- Ordinal encoding is used when there is a clear order among the categories.\n",
    "- Label encoding is used when categories are nominal, and their order is arbitrary."

    "- Covariance is a statistical measure that describes the extent to which two random variables change together. It indicates whether an increase in one variable is associated with an increase or decrease in another variable.\n",

    "**Calculation:**\n",
    "The covariance between two variables X and Y, denoted as Cov(X, Y), can be calculated using the formula:\n",

    "**Normalization with Correlation:**\n",
